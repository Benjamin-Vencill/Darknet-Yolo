## How to annotate the video ##
First take a look at the demo of this system

[![Demo 1](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ljI5pAowACc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljI5pAowACc#t=93)

Our requirements are purely annotations of tvs, which does not move so often as cars or persons in the demo. So it is relatively easier compared to the demo.

Here is another one I made just for this task. Check out this one

Because the final goal of this project is to determine how much time people spend on watching TV, we want the annotation of the tv to be extermely precise, meaning 
1. The bounding box should be very tight.
2. The starting frame and ending frame of a television should be very precise, meaning neither should you skip frames where there is TV nor should you annotate things that are not TV.
